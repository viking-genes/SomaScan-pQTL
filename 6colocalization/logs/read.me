The coloc script would fail if it encountered an openGWAS dataset with NA as sample size. There is a surprising number of these, therefore those datasets have been assigned the sample size manually in the script (see 2colocalization.R).
After the script encounters such a file, the script was edited and continued with an edited dataset to not run again the rows that ran successfully.
